# todo-list

## Todo List App

This is a simple ToDo List App built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Webpack and following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.

## Features

- Add tasks to the ToDo List.
- Edit tasks by clicking on them.
- Delete tasks by clicking on the delete button.

## MVC Pattern

The app follows the MVC pattern to keep the code organized and modular:

- Model: The TodoList class represents the model and holds the state of the app.
- View: The View class handles the rendering of the app UI based on the state of the model.
- Controller: The Controller class acts as the mediator between the model and the view, handling user interactions and updating the model and the view accordingly.

## Webpack
Webpack is used to bundle and manage the app's assets and dependencies. The webpack.config.js file defines the entry point, output file, loaders, and plugins.
